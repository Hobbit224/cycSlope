# cycSlope
## Made with Express, Javascript, jQuery, Booststrap, and CSS

### Overview
cycSlope is a route planning web application for users who are looking to choose their routes based on elevation change. Using Google Maps APIs, it allows users to enter any starting point and destination point, and cycSlope will provide three route options complete with a static map of the route and a visual line graph to display the elevation changes in each.

### Challenges and Solutions
#### Learning SourceTree and GitHub
	-Merge conflicts due to limited experience working with Sourcetree and Github
#### Processing Get/Post requests in a Single-Page Application
	-Linking PointA & PointB submit/input fields to put map in on “Page 2” (Kept breaking the slide from “Page 1” to “Page 2” while remaining on main index page)
		-Removed <form>. Used scripts.js to collect input data instead. This maintained the functionality between the Page1/Page2 scrolling
#### JavaScript Promises
